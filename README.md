# MDD-project
This is the machine learnig implementation on MDD depression project. It contains mainly two tasks:
1. Supervised learning on the control and MDD groups (Classification).
* Random Forest (RF)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) 
2. Unsupervised learning on the MDD subgroups (Clustering). 
* P-Value (Linear Regression)
* Hierarchical Clustering 
## Prerequisites
